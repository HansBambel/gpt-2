I was walking out the front door at the end of the day. Or, if you think about it, from the last corner of the building that still managed to maintain its old feel. I was coming back from my friend Dylan's party at the nearby town bar. My destination, I had decided, was a tucked-away place to leave the really bad beats behind. The beaming bartender saw me as I walked out, smiled. \"Hi, asshole,\" he said with a warm smile. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"This is a try-n-get-out-of-jail thing, remember? We can fuck and tell each other what happened and what not to do next time.\" \"Sorry. Yeah, all those things. Hey, for the last time.\" \"I'm not saying you're a criminal.

My hands curled around the thin brass flimsy ball, twisting it, making it ring more haunting than anything else in this place. But this ball, this replica of Aldo's brass ball, was all I had. Because I was close. I was right. And there's nothing more I could say or do to keep from this immortality. Not until I found someone to kill. And that was the only way I could be sure. The ball's grip upon my thumb tightened as if it held the scythe to my throat. The pain was horrible. Nothing I'd ever experienced was so painful. But I held on. I held on to whatever power this tiny ball held. A pathetic soul might live only a year longer. And perhaps I would grow so. Maybe the last time I would see Aldo would be the last. But then. As if fate should have any hand in this. When fate should have any hand in this. My door unlocked. I went to the hallway, making a faint and hurried entrance in my tired and tired movements. As soon as I entered I closed the door behind me. Clothy footfalls, like they were coming out of a dozen pages, echoed in my ears. But I was ready. I began to walk. The door rolled ajar. As it did so. I knew it was Aldo. I stepped through his door and he was now waiting for me, waiting for me, in the hallway. I was so close, so much closer, I had to step out of my chair and turn back. I rushed over. I clutched the ball. I felt the tiny wooden knob. I put my finger to the ball. I spun. I stepped out of the room. And now, I wait. \"Mr. Henry, are you allowed to exit without permission from me?\" \"yes.\" \"uhh... well, Mr. Henry,\" he stood up and raised his glasses, \"I am wondering how long you've been locked in here.

It tells me to march to the nearest store and purchase the most basic of supplies: a baseball bat, duct tape, duct tape, and duct tape. “Ah, you’re back in time now,” it says, grinning, “Time for another trip to the store. This one will be a little easier.” I stare at the sign that is written in shiny yellow paper with the logo of the hardware store, “Popular Products & Appliances.” I have never been one for fine motor skills or dexterity, but I quickly take the steps required to climb to the front of the store and inspect every product there, the bigger the better. From the brightly-colored appliances, all the way down to the brightly-colored stationary. The cardboard display cases are inviting, full of colorful blank plastic cases for little vases. It seems to me that this store does not have the smallest staff, as the lone woman who shuffles through them is clearly a stripper, deep in her late twenties. She has hair the color of regal fabrics, and her long legs appear to be made out of a maroon material that looks like jet black cloth. All of this leads me to conclude that this place is homely, or it’s just so run-of-the-mill that I can easily ignore it. “Should I get out” I think to myself, “I’m not really a power forward and I don’t really need this shit.” I set out my clothes in the cooler, and I slowly walk down the street, the store still in sight. While walking down it, I notice something odd in the store. For just a second, I notice a small sign that reads “Home Depot” written on the wall in yellow block letters. I pay it no mind, but then I notice the deep red color of the store lighting that gives away that it’s one of a completely different color.

Chewbacca cried out in indignation, and joined him, clawing at his throat. Han stared at the bloody scene, blood streaked across his face. Luke, in his boxer's black outfit, held his lightsaber high in defeat, as he held his father's cape to his face. Neither man had wanted to cause any trouble. They had been raised to have nothing but common decency. Then he had realised that he had to do something. 'Good, good, good!' Han shouted, and collapsed into his brother's arms. Luke threw himself over him, the source of the lightsaber cutting through the impact, and pulled it upwards, carrying them both into the air. At this point, Luke was more concerned with making his father's cape swing in one motion than taking down Darth Vader. For a moment, he had thought that his father would have a go, but instead, he had been distracted, his attention diverted by Vader's battle, his tentacles trying to climb the inside of Chewbacca's boxers. \"Young master, I wish to teach you a few simple tricks,' Luke shouted, with a degree of exasperation that surprised even him. 'These will not help you in the slightest, you know.' Vader huffed, his tentacle snapping, slicing into his brother's leg. Chewbacca shrieked and buckled beneath him, Luke and Vader clinging to each other. The pair of them were captured. Luke hovered above, his own father's cape in his hand. His master put it on first, and he yelled in surprise. Han tried to move, but was pulled back from his feet. As a result, he was led up onto the bridge, where Vader remained. The laser fire erupted, Han stomping around, ready to rip the man's head from his shoulders. What came instead was a feeling of complete comfort, one of warmth. Luke wrapped the cape around his waist, and it was the only thing that had kept them moving from the impact, a small bulge in his father's tunic. The night was still dark, but the sky was starting to get a little more colourful, with hundreds of stormtroopers trailing around in the sky. Luke's father tugged him along, and Han tensed a bit\n",

He’d left the safety of the training halls, the old training grounds. He’d called his sons to help him get the land back, but they all ignored him. Now, we all found him a few years back, looking to take over the world. We had great weapons, but the revolution, that was the real wonder. We thought ourselves invincible, thinking that we would never need to worry about the enemy again, and to be honest, the enemy took us for granted.

He thought that he would have a chance, so we left our swords, and our armor, and our armour. We were supposed to show him a treaty, to ensure that we’d stop his army, but the samurai had to be told that we’d agreed, and he took up arms to reclaim our lands.

There was enough meat left over, there was enough grain, enough grain in the barns, and there was enough animal fodder, that we could cover every farm.

After being bitten by a werewolf at the age of 6, I could barely remember a thing about my surroundings. In my morning ritual I had several hours to get to sleep, read, and think. I hoped it would calm me down. My mistress lay in her sleeping bag on her bed, curled up in a ball next to her side. A quilter was also carefully rifling through her makeup bag in the far left corner of the room, eyes bent upwards like a puppy. On her belly was a demonic talisman, reminiscent of some ancient cult of Satan. As I thought about how little time I had left I closed my eyes and took a deep breath in to calm myself. It was even better than the usual ritual. When I was bitten at the age of 6 it was so horrible that it destroyed all memory I had and would haunt me until my death. The whores laughed at me for my horrifying memories, the politicians made fun of me for my intelligence. I walked over to the quilter and with the usual wink and nod of a greeting stroked her hair. My mistress had finally fallen asleep and the quilter just burst into tears.

      " [WP] FBI trainee Clarice Starling works hard to advance her career, while trying to hide/put behind her West Virginia roots, of which if some knew, would automatically classify her as being backward or white trash. After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford. While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as Buffalo Bill, who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton, the warden at the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.\n",
      "======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================\n",
      " Clarice is even more scared when Lecter explains to her his non-disclosure agreement with police regarding the case, as he gives her a public televised speech about his secret obsessions, and shows her one of those soapbox speeches where he quotes a famous literary quote he can never work with. Later on, an even more dangerous person was revealed, in the form of Dr. James Ted Bundy, a scientist at the prison, who wanted to introduce a form of experimental controlled human experimentation, specifically for researchers. They were able to access and perform a series of multiple injections on people to see how far they could go. In the end, they got information, who, the outcome of the experiments were based on who exactly liked the experience. For any further comments, please feel free to let me know! Edit: Have a nice day!

Secondarily, I found Derek to be a fascinating character and a hard worker, meaning he was very resilient and resilient. How did I find Derek to be self-aware? I took an interest in L.A. at a young age, and liked L.A. at a young age. In high school, I found that she acted a lot like my mother, but her signature style, the red eyes and big nose was just me. While my mother was a nice woman, I was not happy with my looks, and my mother's piercing blue eyes made my dark brown eyes uncomfortable. It was true what they say, you are what you eat. Apparently, Derek and Danny would go to L.A. together for parties and hold our tail up to prove who's boss, so I began a habit of eating Derek's and Danny's leg meat, the liver and kidneys are real easy on the palate. What attracted me to Derek was that both the jailers and Danny were female, with a lot of soulache behind them, it would be easy for us to hook up with each other. Finally, I discovered that his powers also manifested themselves when he met his soulmates. As I'm reading the beginning of Derek's first chapter, I found out that his powers were based on the fashion codes of both the Los Angeles underworld and the FBI of L.A. This was the reason that my brother, Danny, was behind him. Oh how he was caught for skin-head activities and deadly weapons, sure, but we could talk about it later. Once I had collected the rest of Derek's potentials and ready for his first chapter, I started to write the final part of my WP. Usually, this is done via comments, but we could, as it was part of his first actual chapter. For me, the ending is almost pure joy, as well as awe.

      "[Story] The tale was legion. For one simple, compelling reason. They were guarding people. They couldn't just stroll in and watch a murderer. Some of them were members of secret government organizations, like the FBI and CIA. They had well-classified security clearance, but they were paid for it by being one of the more talented guards. They kept in touch with these agencies through their work. I mean, look at the plot. The penitentiary had been the scene of an organization, likely formed for similar purpose, likely the government, to save the public from such bad people as themselves. Still, this was common. The reason for this, in my mind, was that not all people in prison are criminals. Some of them are doctors, policemen, judges, we call them psychopaths, psychopaths who run amok while people get off. Others were soldiers or soldiers in the military, we call them murderers. Some were just plain gangsters. They weren't as bad as their government made them out to be.

Painstakingly, the scriptwriters research the actress's research in developing the montage. The director, Daryl A. Mitchell (by many considered the greatest screenwriter of all time), makes sure to tease the audience into the grotesque. This illuminates the character at an angle, possibly tilting the balance of the story towards the character's \"horror.\" Most of the actors, the most memorable actress by far, don't even look at Penelope until their characters are glowing from behind the podium. With a face frozen in shock, and movement foggily repositioning themselves, there was absolutely no way to succeed in writing the look of Penelope accurately. And yet, the world's greatest romance was written with such precision and precision, that it still remained far more enjoyable than the translation? Who was this woman? The name and characterizations were perfect, with the unspoken caveat of the film being set at a time of unprecedented transformation. But the kind of knowledge found was inherently limited in scope, merely detailing what was not. \"Finally,\" a woman, \"the world is at peace.\" I shall write more in a future part about Penelope in the future, but this scene is something I will forever treasure. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ EDIT: so I took part in the TES community. :) I get to ask you all what you think, I don't care where you are from, I know you don't all from outside France, but if there's a TES-type game you've ever played, I can tell you about it... thank you all for all the kind words!<|endoftext|>\n",

We were walking in a lonely, dark hallway. Fencing was torn and littered with grass and discarded junk. I looked around frantically, wide-eyed. My mouth was dry and cracked. My hands were still shaky from the spray from the gunships above. The air was wet and smelled of rotting food. None of this made any sense. Everything was so inexplicably still. I turned around.

The dead, my beloved comrades that I felled. Yet they all came back to life. Every one of them having died.

George, a 23-year-old at the school he grew up in, graduated with honors last spring. The team he set out to compete with had a knack for melody, something that the professors of mathematics knew well. While there was often a small victory for the boys when it came to the competition, many a competitive pair had instead taken to the silver-or, not quite gold-plated seat at the other end of the floor, singing along to the standard level of musicality that the students learned. They had been a pairing that had prevailed over them all. \"Yes, I understand that you've come to play the concertina as a piece.\" \"Indeed, professor. I am honoured. I feel this song to be a fitting follow-up to a very successful University tenure.\" \"Oh, quite right, boy. You should sit down first. Now, perhaps you'd like to begin?\" After a moment, George sat down. The singer had already placed the play of an ancient instrument around the bass and first string, and while he didn't respond, his son was obliged to follow suit. \"Your show begins.\" George took a breath. He heard his son sigh, which showed in a slight frown. The crowd in the hall was the same size as his, but was much more highly-prized. He knew that a range of musical instruments and instruments was tied to a student's academic standing. A winner was able to secure a more prestigious position in music, and many winners had had these in their same coin, every graduate of the university displaying an impressive musical aptitude.

Ripper of Burpelson Air Force Base, believing that fluoridation of the American water supply is a Soviet plot to poison the U.S. populace, is able to deploy through a back door mechanism a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union without the knowledge of his superiors, including the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Buck Turgidson, and President Merkin Muffley. Only Ripper knows the code to recall the B-52 bombers and he has shut down communication in and out of Burpelson as a measure to protect this attack. Ripper's executive officer, RAF Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (on exchange from Britain), who is being held at Burpelson by Ripper, believes he knows the recall codes if he can only get a message to the outside world. Meanwhile at the Pentagon War Room, key persons including Muffley, Turgidson and nuclear scientist and adviser, a former Nazi named Dr. Strangelove, are discussing measures to stop the attack or mitigate its blow-up into an all out nuclear war with the Soviets. Against Turgidson's wishes, Muffley brings Soviet Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky into the War Room, and get his boss, Soviet Premier Dimitri Kisov, on the hot line to inform him of what's going on. The Americans in the War Room are dismayed to learn that the Soviets have an as yet unannounced Doomsday Device to detonate if any of their key targets are hit. As Ripper, Mandrake and those in the War Room try and work the situation to their end goal, Major T.J. \"King\" Kong, one of the B-52 bomber pilots, is working on his own agenda of deploying his bomb where ever he can on enemy soil if he can't make it to his intended target.\n",

Meanwhile to the East, the Soviet Leader Komsomolets attends the closing session of the Ethereal Council with his military advisors on the African continent, signaling the end of the Khrushchev's Soviet Union. Ripper leads a counter-attack on the non-threatening American capital, New York, and the Soviet Union pulls back its troops to defend the American President's state when Ripper hits the steppes to get the rest of his bombers and some of his experienced pilots. Now the American and Soviet leaders are at an impasse, not knowing which is which. Ripper, still hoping for a truce as he had once hoped for a quick and mutually beneficial denuclearization deal, orders his bomber squadron to make first contact with the Soviet Union, and Muffley, Hat and Turgidson are to land in the USSR. To the East, the powers of the Stars and Stripes are deployed against the Soviet Union in a surprise strike, while the newly resurrected US Marine Corps is deployed on Russian soil to secure nuclear exchanges. The six US Air Force B-52 bombers land on Russian soil and drop a uranium delivery bomb on the Soviet Union, forcing the bombs to be detonated via explosives beneath the Soviet Union's monuments. Without any of the maintenance, the atomic bombs can't be dismantled and have to be modified. Once the bombs are dropped, Ripper's bombers knock out the entire Soviet Force and nuclear submarines in the face, leaving the Soviets and Americans free for a gas genocide against anyone who stands in their way. Ripper now orders the bombers to drop another uranium bomb on the Soviet Union for good measure. Once the American and Soviet leaders, not knowing which is which, are at each other's throats, a black cloud of death descends upon them both.

      " [WP] Gerd Wiesler is an officer with the Stasi, the East German secret police. The film begins in 1984 when Wiesler attends a play written by Georg Dreyman, who is considered by many to be the ultimate example of the loyal citizen. Wiesler has a gut feeling that Dreyman can't be as ideal as he seems, and believes surveillance is called for. The Minister of Culture agrees but only later does Wiesler learn that the Minister sees Dreyman as a rival and lusts after his partner Christa-Maria. The more time he spends listening in on them, the more he comes to care about them. The once rigid Stasi officer begins to intervene in their lives, in a positive way, protecting them whenever possible. Eventually, Wiesler's activities catch up to him and while there is no proof of wrongdoing, he finds himself in menial jobs - until the unbelievable happens.\n",

He is a husband to real estate agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high school student Janie Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other, they now merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Janie too hates both her parents, the three who suffer individually in silence in their home life. Janie tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career, she aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Janie's more experienced classmate, Angela Hays. Both Janie and Angela can see Lester's sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and it a career to which she aspires. Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly subversive eighteen year old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his father's rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much like Lester's infatuation, Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Janie, he who considers girls like Angela as ordinary. The entry of Angela and the Fittses into the Burnhams' lives ultimately leads to each of the players confronting what is truly in his or her heart.\n",

The concept of the movie is nothing new, but, judging from the words of the two cast and crew members that enter the place, the sets are completely different. And the a much smaller crowd. The interior is lit by warm tungsten torches around the tableau; a cinder block facade from the McDonalds where all the interviews are taking place. The interior takes up two thirds of the film, and the atmosphere, in the rest of the building, was frankly absent of much entertainment. The only enjoyment here was watching the performance of the actors, and their banter with each other and the crew in the halls and above the restaurant walls. The few paid attention to the exterior of the house in New York was cut short, though the little red Mustang located in the basement of the house was in full-camouflage, seemingly caked in snow and ice. Inside the interior, the interior still was decidedly filled with cold, industrial decor and harsh light that would make any live human observer nauseous, but what was in front of the door as the two actors entered was a surprise. The floor, which was illuminated only by the floors, was dirty and had streaks of graffiti sprayed across the whole interior. There was a mattress on the floor that had the letter 'N' written across it, written neatly in red paint. It was, in fact, burnt. A mat under the door that was undamaged by the weather was completely soaked, showing that the heat of the other room was still in full effect. The yellow drippings that trickled down from the windows were recognizable by its freshness. Finally, the set was silent. The street was dark. The actors turned the corner in a daze. \"Welcome to this neighborhood, Mr. Harrison,\" a voice said over a loudspeaker. The actor looked up and found himself looking at a woman with arms covered in blood. He took a step back, startled, and as his eyes were about to adjust, he saw that her blonde hair was peeled back and dangling like a tail. He lifted his hand to shield himself, before he looked to the camera: \"My name is Kevin Dillon, I'm Michael McClane, and today is our first day in New\n",

I know you'll like it, pal.\" Ken nodded his head. \"What about the secret address?\" \"The secret address is a landfill.\" I stared at him. \"You can't do that.

There is a button somewhere on your uniform, don't you remember?\" The captain of the boat nodded sadly. \"But you can't come with us, we don't even have the ship.

Rose loses no time in forcing her rather gay husband to sign and Helen finds it an easy matter to obtain the signature of her sweetheart, Jim. Unfortunately, Mr. Love is met by a number of old friends who insist upon him taking a drink before he goes home, in spite of the pledge, which they ridicule. He falls off the water-wagon and is soon in no condition to dine at home; he, therefore, phones his wife that he is obliged to work late. Jim, who really has to work, also phones that he cannot come. Helen thinks he is not telling the truth and a lonely evening is passed by both women. In the meantime Harry ends up the night by dining in a cabaret, and when it is time to leave he can hardly stagger. In a rather helpless condition he is found leaning against a post by Jim, who, having finished his work, is returning home. Jim consents to help Harry home. Harry insists upon being taken in through the kitchen, where he knocks over a table. The noise awakens Rose and her sister, who immediately think of burglars. Rose dons her husband's clothes and, with a pistol, the women go downstairs to face the burglar. Jim sees Helen with a man's arms around her and denounces her. Rose denounces Jim for having brought her husband home in such a condition. The next morning Harry explains that Jim had not been drinking but had met him and brought him home.

As such, Han Solo was glad that he didn’t carry one with him, as the trip from the Second Battle of Hoth to Yavin 4 would be a long one.

His hand reached up to take a breath of the planets cold air. In that instant, he’d wished that he had a suit of armor or a lightsaber with him, because Luke Skywalker’s superluminal engines and blaster pistol didn’t exactly protect against a Sith Lord’s lightsaber. At that moment, the Jedi found himself in a rather unpleasant body. The only acceptable body part to appear on the person of a Sith was a thick beard. The dark-robed man was wearing a white and purple-scaled Jedi robe, like those worn by the apprentice of the great master Yoda, but his attire gave little clue as to who he was. He stood from his usual position and, instead, sat down on his cell at the foot of the wall. Before he could register that he was in a new situation, he felt a cold bead of moisture in the back of his neck, which he shook as quickly as he could. He felt a cold sting on his back. Luke looked at his helmet, because his companion’s face was covered in a thick cloud of darkness. The blue sky, white-and-purple-scaled, cloud wearing man had begun to form the shape of a mask, stretching out in the intense reds of the beginning of the lightsaber’s activation sequence. His face was covered by a thick and pla-pla helmet, which had drawn the Force from him so that he could view the face of his wife as she died in his arms, the helmet rotating slowly to protect his eyes. The suit itself was a black version of the Jedi ones, though unlike those, the glow of the Force was distinct, having the purity of an elder Jedi.

Yes, let me share my dream with you. I was sitting at the dinner table of friends having my son's birthday. We all went out to the garden to play. Just a bunch of friends having a party. We all laughed, played basketball and poker and the pool. My son walked into the room, with a knife in his hand. Everyone let out a gasp. The green pool lighting him up like a blinding spotlight. It was a black \"Star Wars\" thing, where everything was placed on a planet in the same galaxy as you could see. ''Say again, son.'' My dear husband was a doctor and he looked on just calmly. ''What happened in that family?'' I asked, ''I swear to god'' ''You saw him, son. He picked up a knife'' the doctor repeated. ''Dude, not again.'' The feeling in my stomach returned. It felt like the right thing to do, but still. Something just didn't feel right. ''Sure, the bad looks are a personal thing, but this is nothing you guys should ever tolerate'' the doctor advised. I took a deep breath. ''No, not again. You need to leave and leave now'' ''Oh, do you know the website I can search for speed bumps? You should really check it out. Something to slow you down, for example'' ''That is unacceptable'' The doctors eyes were still peering over the knife in his hand. ''Alright, alright. It can wait. What should I do?'' I said. ''You can probably tell. Now just kill yourself'' ''Damn you'' was his last word. But if I did it today, at least I'd get a place to die. Maybe then I could say something about it to my son and he could probably stop me. Maybe if I brought him something to make it last more than two hours. Whatever I did I was not sure if I would get a rush of joy in him from killing himself, because I didn't even know how I would die without it. Eventually my eyes were locked on my son's eyes. His eyes looked tired, tired, tired. He was staring at the TV. ''You couldn't have me.'' I knew I didn't get to say that. He was simply smiling. Waiting. Watching. ''You could have me\n",

      "[Story] The earliest memories I had of Mitsuha's story were vivid. We were at the store, her in the register and I in my usual outfit, just a shirt and pants, and the usual bewilderment from my sister when she saw my outfit. “Oh,” she would say. “I guess we were going to go home for the night. I was looking for something to wear.” We went home in the car, of course, back when I was still a teenager. “I bet it’s nice outside tonight,” Mitsuha said. “I didn’t want to think about it,” I said. We talked for hours about the craftsmanship of books. I was working on my first coffee shop, which was exactly what I wanted; it’s a small part-time job. And Mitsuha was dying to get coffee that night, so we started talking about the brewing process. I had so much to learn about coffee brewing, but we talked until the morning, and all the while she was weaving yarn in her braids, knitting at the shop. The stories of our journey were short, but full of strange innuendo. Of the lost ones and how they found each other. How we had come to be strangers who shared a little boat with those ugly, bloodthirsty, water creatures. When I asked Mitsuha where she found these stories, she smiled a clever smile. “It’s no big deal to tell the story,” she said. “It’s just a small book that I picked up when I was a little girl. We love reading about that.” At home, we got home and Mitsuha had what looked like a glow in her eyes. She was glowing so brightly that the store manager had to come and clean the stapler off of me as I was going to leave. Then, before he could say anything, she was gone. We thought it was over. It had been almost a week now, and we were just beginning to get comfortable with each other. With Mitsuha gone, the memories of that time were finally ours. And after all, who was ever going to believe us anyway? My room was brighter. My jeans were fresh and damp, and all the wrinkles that covered my face were slowly coming back to life.

      "[Story] Hartman had always been a hard worker, having graduated from West Point in a time when service in the military wasn't just the patriotic thing it was now. You could find him driving the wives away in the oak colonies he sometimes prowled, trying to get his hands on some Vodka to fall asleep with. Hartman got his master's, one of the better ones in the US; no one was given such a prestigious award on military service, certainly not enough to be decorated with a military jacket, much less a crossword puzzle. Not much prestige for such a highly-rated Corps, but they would never forget that. After all, Hartman was one of the best guns ever. At times he was as elite as the training grounds themselves, and that became apparent when, during a combat drill, he struck out at his old friend \"Tommy\" Baker. Upon impact, Baker was a toothpick, well beyond his five-year service at the infamous 350 yard ranges, and that very day, so many of the men swore vengeance on him. Hartman's life was not going to end the way he had imagined. He was an engineer, capable of many things, of course he was not to command a wheel. But one thing he could do. When asked to apply his engineering skill to most of the defense projects, Hartman invented exactly what he wanted, from scratch. Some decades later, he was one of the men chosen to fight the communist menace in Cambodia. His mind always trying to find ways to kill the animals that lived within the perimeter of Vietnam, instead, it would allow them to successfully flee the horrors of the communists. For no one did better, nor did better at a better rate, than Hartman, the last soldier in the world, to march so impassively into the enemy lines. And yet, one must admit that he was actually kind of a dork, if only in the information vacuum he always floated in. Making important decisions, before realising that they were a bad idea, and then pulling his parachute and dropping out into enemy territory without having any training or gear to protect him was one thing. But it was a fine way to learn, he would say. Hartman couldn't help but do that. He was guided by an entire stable of mediocre political figures and officials who never got to do any actual work, those who, in Hartman's words, were 'get your party's autograph on an iPhone'.

      " [WP] 1927 Hollywood. Monumental Pictures' biggest stars, glamorous on-screen couple Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood, are also an off-screen couple if the trade papers and gossip columns are to be believed. Both perpetuate the public perception if only to please their adoring fans and bring people into the movie theaters. In reality, Don barely tolerates her, while Lina, despite thinking Don beneath her, simplemindedly believes what she sees on screen in order to bolster her own stardom and sense of self-importance. R.F. Simpson, Monumental's head, dismisses what he thinks is a flash in the a bona fide hit which results in all the movie theaters installing sound equipment that R.F. knows Monumental, most specifically in the form of Don and Lina, have to jump on the talking picture bandwagon, despite no one at the studio knowing anything about the technology. Musician Cosmo Brown, Don's best friend, gets hired as Monumental's ideas man and musical director. And by this time, Don has secretly started dating Kathy Selden, a chorus girl who is trying to make it big in pictures herself. Don and Kathy's relationship is despite their less than friendly initial meeting. Cosmo and Kathy help Don, who had worked his way up through the movie ranks to stardom, try make the leap to talking picture stardom, with Kathy following along the way. However, they have to overcome the technological issues. But the bigger problem is Lina, who will do anything to ensure she also makes the successful leap into talking pictures, despite her own inabilities and at anyone and everyone else's expense if they get in her way, especially Kathy as Don's off screen girlfriend and possibly his new talking picture leading lady.\n",

      " According to rumors, Lina told Cosmo she wanted Don's eyes. So Cosmo started work on the technology, but Lina was able to swing it through to the viewing public's attention. For the whole world, it looks like the worst romantic comedy ever. Don and Lina tear up on screen after the poor date, and Cosmo grows visibly annoyed as he learns, truth is, he hated that movie. Let's call it a win, although Don might be counting himself lucky as his girlfriend is also an artist and benefits from being able to understand the medium's inner workings better than he does. But Lina tries to intimidate Don, it's the exact opposite of how he might get her into movies, and he finds her distasteful because of how much she needs Don. Feeling that his manhood is compromised, Don asks Lina to have a drink with him, just so he can get her drunk, as she takes the blame, Lina has even started to flaunt her star-baby status, declaring that her and Don are married. But Don feels it's best not to break up with his girlfriend yet. The two get along splendidly, until Kathy turns down their joint movie which results in the set-up for the Hollywood riots, resulting in the movie flopping and a lot of deaths. Some of Don's precious movie, his greatest film, merely floundered at the box office because of the media making up shoo-show about how Don is responsible for the delay. It's true, Don knew the huge star turn he had coming and would receive as much sympathy for it. His girlfriend, all for Don, tears a bond with a young Hollywood actress whose name was Lacey Golden, and Linda Oliver. Let's say one thing, don't believe the gossip papers, it's only been a couple years. Don and Lina share a perfectly intimate amount of love, but she never had any more chances in Hollywood, being the sort of girl Don often wished for. Maybe she'd manage it this time around.

Baxter has been working at Consolidated Life, an insurance company, for close to four years, and is one of close to thirty-two thousand employees located in their Manhattan head office. To distinguish himself from all the other lowly cogs in the company in the hopes of moving up the corporate ladder, he often works late, but only because he can't get into his apartment, located off of Central Park West, since he has provided it to a handful of company executives - Mssrs. Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - on a rotating basis for their extramarital liaisons in return for a good word to the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake. When Baxter is called into Sheldrake's office for the first time, he learns that it isn't just to be promoted as he expects, but also to add married Sheldrake to the list to who he will lend his apartment. What Baxter is unaware of is that Sheldrake's mistress is Fran Kubelik, an elevator girl in the building who Baxter himself fancies. In turn, Sheldrake has no idea of Baxter's own interest in Fran. And Fran, who is in love with Sheldrake, has no idea that she is only the latest in a long line of Sheldrake's mistresses, that Sheldrake has no intention of leaving his wife for her, and that the apartment belongs to Baxter, who she likes as a friend. As some of these facts come to light on Christmas Eve, one of the three makes a unilateral decision. That decision sets off a series of events over the course of the next week which makes each of the three examine what he/she really wants which in turn may be incompatible with the other two. They are helped along the way by Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger who are now feeling neglected as Baxter no longer needs their assistance in moving up, by Miss Olsen, Sheldrake's long serving secretary who was also once his mistress, and by Dr. Dreyfus, a physician and one of Baxter's many exasperated neighbors who believes Baxter is a playboy based on all the noise he hears in Baxter's apartment and the plethora of empty liquor bottles Baxter seems to be always discarding.\n",

While everyone else was gushing about Baxter, Sheldrake was starting to feel depressed as he had failed his boss. This depressed them even more, as Baxter is now the only assistant a.C.U. has to a.C.U. The senior partner can really get down on his knees and beg for his life. Because Sheldrake got to Sheldrake on Christmas Eve and found him depressed and angry with her. When Sheldrake went down and did something of his own, however, Baxter would not have his father's patience. He decided to ask the A.C.U. why they did not allow him in to the office, and the A.C.U. obliged him. Sheldrake knew what he wanted to do with the A.C.U., because he had chosen his life after that and wanted to run away and save up for what he really wanted. Being so close to his ex-wife, his father, and his mother, he knew he did not want to be able to afford it, so he knew that he would pay for it. When the A.C.U. called him back, his sad demeanor did not convey how despondent he really felt. And as he heard himself say that he wanted to work for them with Hercule, the A.C.U. was shocked that he had actually decided to join the union. Hercule's quiet calm approach, it seemed, won the day over Baxter's stormy answers that he had been planning to talk with the A.C.U. about the state of the business. As Baxter embraced his father and mother and started to cry, the A.C.U. cried with him as well and walked out of the room.<|endoftext|>\n",

A white plastic tube, wrapped around a blocky stick of plastic, with a glistening plastic cord around it. The room itself is filled with plastic tubes, many strange shapes, large objects in-between, and wires. There are a good many tubes of different materials, all made of the same kind of plastic and with the same amount of material wrapped around them. They seem to be arranged inside of one long-packed monstrosity, with many tubes slung about it. There are many long bars of wood surrounding the tube, and many wires running along them. And the world begins to form. The wire lets the tubes separate. There are too many tubes and many wires. Most of them are wrapped about each other in plastic, with tubes being tightly coupled together with some wires hanging down from the ceiling like a hanger.

      " It's unlikely that anyone actually bothered to watch it; it's rather boring. Plenty of interviews and theorizing have been done, and many threads in a single look at the film. Most notably, Willis interview and screen-capping of the film features the moderator tossing out a comment about how the crowd laughed at his jokes. In that context, the fact that Bruce Willis actually was one of the actors credited in the film is a pretty good summation of the film. In a lot of ways, this show is a mixed bag; as a serious piece of media analysis, it can also serve as an entertainment. Viewing the film is something of a universal experience for those who were too young or too old for the original. There's been a ton of reaction to the first sequel; it was received very differently by critics, which makes the original's reach a little more wide, and the content overall very different. Some of the more hardened critics have personally commented on the changes, some of the younger ones have picked up the film and have commented on the horror it depicts. Without a lot of new information, the show has been around for a few years, though the production has been changing a bit. The segments on the movie have received further treatment, as recent recap episodes and biographical documentaries have popped up, and a new series has been added. But the series, which is still under production, has yet to be released. Both is an open question as to how many people are actually paying attention to this show and how many are just watching from excuses for the continuation of a show they used to enjoy on their computers. It's hard to assess that without knowing the audience, so a particularly easy A+ would be an \"A\" without the additions. Some of the commentary on the film is already included, though, so the fact that I even have to read it is pretty impressive. I'm sure there are plenty of others to be found, but this show seems to focus on my favorite movie and seems to carry some \"audience response\" for this movie. I just can't put my finger on why anyone is spending this much time on this show. Perhaps it's because some executives or company executives have been told how much they suck as critics. Hopefully this program isn't as influential or commercial as something as free or extremely cheap. There's really no excuse for not watching it, but it's still not like there are very many other shows out there to get through either. B- <|endoftext|>\n",

With newfound popularity, the sports team finally changed its name to \"The Whirlwind\", a portmanteau of his former nickname \"Whipping Boy\", and his former nickname \"The Ringer\". Then, with the danger of any more players taking the name of their former coach and his notorious ex-wife \"Match Game\", it was released in an official remake that used the first name, as well as his ex wife's maiden name, and an uninterested parent's initials \"Nash\" to call the team \"The Ninja\". And then, with the new popularity of \"The Whirlwind\" and \"The Ninja\", the team started competing again.

      "[Story] We were taken to court for a trial for all of Hitler’s surviving Nazi leaders. The trial was held over three days in order to determine what crimes they had committed and to determine how they had been stripped of their liberty. While these Nazi leaders were still alive, they were not to be forced to answer questions on the security details of the entire world. We were free to question any questions we wanted to, from the greatness of our nation’s leadership to whether or not the genocide of the Jews was justified. We knew that the Soviet Union was quick to respond to any questioning, and with the threat of war, some of us were surprised the Soviet Union would allow it. The first question that was asked of us was how do you reconcile your beliefs with the way the world really is. The entire world was plagued by war, poverty, and terrible human rights abuses. Why would people willingly consent to this? What justified these genocides? Where did these genocides come from? The second question was perhaps more pressing; what justification could we make of bringing our political leaders to trial? What seemed like a perfect America led Europe was more than a decade apart by the time of our trial. Germany alone was responsible for the vast majority of humanity being driven to extinction. The Soviet Union had killed over a billion people and their Russian counterparts took 5 billion more. Where were these three other genocides when we needed them? It seemed like the conversation was entirely moot. The decision was a simple yes or no; the only explanation being the fact that it was because the world wasn’t so good anymore. It was understandable. How could these people not have good enough lives to justify genocide against millions of innocent people? This world, full of people suffering needlessly, deserves better than us. It’s shameful that it needed this trial in the first place. There was no point in even going back.” The first question that was asked of us was, How could you possibly justify bringing your political leaders to trial? “Where do you even begin to justify it?” we asked of the Soviet justice system. “You don’t know?” it replied. We asked again. “Does anybody?” It’s answer shook me out of my shock, and my mind was screaming at me, it had lost all its sanity. “I don’t know how.” “You don’t.�\n",

      " [WP] The film deals with the situation of British prisoners of war during World War II who are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway. Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge but, under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit and dignity in adverse circumstances. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese commandant Saito. He is an honorable but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy. Unknown to him, the Allies have sent a mission into the jungle, led by Warden and an American, Shears, to blow up the bridge.\n",

      " When the Doctors find the remains of the bridge, they believe the bridge to be a Japanese kamikaze attack, intended to destroy morale, force surrender and drive out the Americans. Upon searching the bridge, they discover that the documents Nicholson and his men had lying around had been used to show the Japanese their future enemies. These documents were produced on the same sheets as these modern Koriyama Enterprise huts, and instead of setting up a picnic for the prisoners, the Japanese planted the same large blue flag of the Pacific States across the bridge. Eventually, the prisoners revolt, and successfully blow up the bridge. Nicholson becomes a prisoner of war, serving the Japanese. One of the Allied heroes, the veteran of the invasion, sends Nicholson the letters that he wrote on the camp wardrobes in the weeks before he got captured. The letters were saved by a Japanese soldier who fell, and Nicholson was subsequently captured and detained by the Allied Japanese army. Nicholson, instead of becoming a propaganda asset, was considered a traitor by the Japanese, and was ordered to serve the enemy, despite the outrage he would surely suffer. The Allied Japan jumped into a now-bloody war with Australia and New Zealand, and the Japanese simply vanished. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&\n",

I never thought in a million years I'd be able to do anything more to protect you. And here I am. The only one left. How long does it take to do something? Too long. So the first thing I was going to do was ask you why, for the past 10 years I've been having this damn headache. I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to ask you. When I asked you, you said: \"because the Reich is the end of everything.\" Not you, the Reich. You just said \"the end of everything\". And now they have struck, and everything you were there for is done, the time has come, and I am the only one left. I'm the one. I'm not you. You are not me. You are not the world. You are a cancer, a force that consumes and destroys, that reeks of sadness, and pales the emotions of men, of women, of children, and through all of them, I will not save them. Not when I don't even know if they are even going to be there when I'm ready. So now they are gone. They will not be coming back to us. You will have them. You have them in your heart. The greatest cause that has ever existed was put in place in the first place, to stop you from doing evil. It is about time you saw the error of your ways, and began your salvation. Your path is dark. It's dark, and I am there. And I'm ready. I've never seen you this way before. A hero. A villain. A legend. Who is the one hero in a world of villains? I've never seen you so defeated. This is the hero. I am the reason they were able to call you All-Powerful-Strangely-Strong. And this is your salvation. Your time has come. <|endoftext|>\n",

      "[W]e are on vacation in the Mediterranean when a sea beast nearly crashes into the cargo boat. In it's fury, it covers the boat with spray and destroys it. Mrs. de Winter discovers our small fishing boat from the coast of Venice. With a thirst for blood, she sets out to rescue Rebecca, despite its enormous size and the fact that everyone else is inside the boat. Before we can sink the boat in the icy waters, the boat sinks into the bow of the beast. Because there is no helm, the boat sinks onto the beast, sinking both boat and its passengers into the sea. The beast and Mrs. de Winter remain there to wait for the water to recede. Their belongings are now swallowed by the sea. This happens a few times. The grieving wife and Max speak in private. While the male runs to the boat and swims away to rescue Rebecca, Mrs. de Winter peeks over the side of the boat and sees that Max is keeping the water supply running. She summons him to her chambers and begs him to open the water tank to retrieve Rebecca's body. Instead, he scampers away, leaving the water tank off-limits. The very next morning, Mrs. de Winter rescues Rebecca and swears fealty to Max. As Rebecca lies inside the ice pack, Mrs. de Winter gives birth to a son, Max. Mrs. de Winter declares the name Max, since Max is her husband's name. As Max grows into a boy, Mrs. de Winter refuses to let her daughter, Mary, marry him. _____________________________________________________________________________ /r/WrittenThought<|endoftext|>\n",

The weapon he had strapped on his back, still dripping with blood. The cloth stained with his corpse's red, not appearing to have gotten a whiff of the rain. The corpse looked at me in the mirror. I grinned, seeing his face warped by my eyes. He gave me a small smile. I then looked back at him, knowing that nothing else mattered to him, and just said, \"Well, are we there yet?\" \"Go,\" he said, placing his hands on his knees. He lifted his head, and smiled as I followed suit. As his eyes turned back to the reflection of the mirror I had on my hands, his mouth widened in a manner that was unmistakably broken. He began to sob, nearly taking a step back, before leaning forward. His eyes then started to close, the colors shifting, and the feeling that had remained in my arms faded, leaving a numb emptiness. He looked at me again, and his eyes shifted between me and the mirror, before looking back at me again. \"I'm going to leave,\" he said, looking at me with the sadness that he had normally held in, and ending with, his eyes shifting back to my mirror. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered. \"It's not important anymore. I'm going to leave you to me, and you should too.\" He picked up the gun and removed it from his back, taking it's barrel and placing it on his waist. \"I'm going to leave you to me. Don't come with me, and don't look at me. Don't even be mad. Just, be quiet.\" He pulled the trigger. The bullet hit me in the chest. As I held up my breath, I felt Bill's pain show on his own body.

But really, since that time, people began to look at all the good people they lived alongside as their inspiration and hoped for their future happiness, and so with that came the idea of an unlimited existence for everyone. There is a sense of pride, of hope, of belonging, and many will never give up on a good thing. I suppose to a lot of people the idea that anyone could be their inspiration is slightly disturbing. It's hard to come to terms with that when everything you knew your whole life has been replaced with unrealistically distant images - you are constantly shunned and ridiculed, with people in all different shapes and sizes screaming the words, \"You're an embarrassment to us!\" or \"You're just a freak, you're a freak!\" The world is a strange place now - the cure for aging is a multi-billion dollar industry, yet no one speaks to each other. It's only recently that I realized how different it was back then. Everything seemed like a dream - I had seen so many movies and heard so much horror that the world is a strange place. I remember I once stopped, looked around, and realized that I was not in the same world anymore. I imagined myself living in a house with a family that was happy, happy in its bodies, happy in it's secrets, happy in what it gave to the world. The cure for aging has changed that reality - your entire world is now threatened with madness. There is no more nature, only destructive forces. Many are still trying to figure out what to do. People are still dying in droves and people are starving in\n",

      "[Story] \"Oh, fuck me, Sam.\" The words came from another, quieter, cavernous room. I looked around at the \"manager's desk\", the television set that displayed \"Do Not Disturb\" and a picture of a two-by-four. They were talking in Spanish. I realized that this was the only language they could communicate. The conversation was obviously aimed at another actor and I couldn't hear the second actor. They were talking about his son, who was a writer and the subject of their conversation was her \"hero\" and \"anarchist\". She was again talking about the birth of a child with her ex-husband, her son's parents and the subject of her mother's wife's accusations of being a lesbian. The last conversation was another of the actors talking about her ex-husband and her father's son, whom they claimed to be \"stabbed to death by an actor\". Finally, there was a clip of a rock band playing the Hall H Motivational Speaker on a large screen. I wasn't in the room, but he certainly didn't need to know that. The first sound on the television screen was the music from the audience in the back seat. A woman shouted over the television, \"Remember those little ladies in the back of your car? Well it's about time you remembered them! They're in fact the same ones who are kicking your ass!\" I couldn't hear them. The woman on the TV pushed her husband away from the phone. \"Sorry. Not my best, but this is pretty intense.\" The video moved to a picture of a \"star\" singing about the phrase, \"Come on in man, I wanna play.\" The woman on the television then shoved her husband away from the phone and he flew back. The video moved to a picture of two men playing a video game and the video stopped. I watched it for a minute. \"This could be quite interesting.\" I smiled. \"Onward.\" And I turned the television off. I was tempted to make myself talk to the men, to hear their voices, but no. I wasn't in the room, and my memories were pulling me away from the precipice. I was in another story. I had imagined a scene and then some in my head, because I thought the internet was real.

I've been looking at the different faces of people and you can see that I'm not the only one. Everywhere I look, people move. Even when I'm moving from place to place. This happens, and every time, like clockwork. There's a few moments of confusion and nothing is ever weird.

I think it's just the empty feeling. Why was I so happy? I'd always dreamed of flying around the world for a few months. But I guess I was excited to meet new people and probably got carried away by how everything is quite small and perfect. Maybe people on the plane felt the same. As soon as I stepped off the plane, I felt all the excitement draining from me. I couldn't find it in my heart anymore, so I figured I'd just get up and walk through the world for the next few days. As soon as I noticed a familiar street, I found myself there. Stumbling around through the city, looking for the ones I needed.

Paul's thought that the native population as a whole who are not directly involved in the conflict will be protected as the UN peacekeeping forces and thus the world is watching doesn't happen as the western world largely evacuates from Rwanda and abandons the natives. Such begins what will become a genocide of the Tutsi population.

The dreaded policy of not hiring anyone known to be involved in terrorism had happened more than once in the past. No one had ever asked him how his last two daughters' personalities would fit in his household. They were the youngest of eight children, and though he did admit he was not a particularly good father, he was still very much a man of the people. Another unpleasant process to go through in an already chaotic work-place. Suffer his employer to jump him in the sack. Not that it was a big blow either, particularly when the pick-up boy for the marketing firm was a veritable celebrity. Dan had long ago forgotten how he had ended up with the company, let alone how his sister hadn't come running for the water cooler, shouting down and promising that if she didn't find the wife for him, he would give her a phone call and he would be happy to take her. The concern of the industry was never far from his mind. No, his awareness of the dangers of terrorism must also have been some of the hardest to leave behind. After all, he had no, easy access to the wider world. He could never afford the trip that the previously infrequent travelers required to understand that travel was not necessarily the quick and easy cure for anything. He'd seen, and experienced it firsthand, how highly regarded and how self-important the terrorist organizations themselves were. Even if there had been a bit of exaggeration, the term 'terrorist' was an even more insufferable thing to describe. Even the harshest of the suicide bombers, in the depths of their anguish, were clearly experiencing regret that they'd spent so much time discussing their futures with someone else. Though the potential wasn't what it was cracked up to be, he was sure he could pass as a terrorist. Then there was the added dimension to the entire experience. In their misguided sense of security, the governments had given everyone a false sense of safety, believing that their safety was something they could really rely on. Or at least, as he had heard it, what the government had done for the sake of its security. And no one knew what the FU's actually did in their name, anyway.

But, if I, your average human, wished to view any of that to be true, what I was and what was it? We knew what would happen in a single stage of life. It was simply a matter of looking out the car window and shooting up. And, if we wished to see the plot, let alone the climax, then the following actions would be needed. And I had never once considered the possibility of seeing the whole thing, or asking for something from the character. In reality, any angle was welcomed. We know what we want, after all.

But, by now, we had thought that we had raced in Europe. We knew then that, had we not run a bad race, then we would surely win the championship that we were going to a camera and be interviewed by. It was, I suppose, a genuine shock when, in reality, I had never thought of it that way. But, I had thought of it. And, so, I had asked for the famous man who, decades ago, had raced across Europe in a factory sports car, and, had won over Europe. He, had led his team to become the official Champions League team, and we had taken our World Cup title back home for the first time in many years. The man, I guess, did not actually appear in the film. But I knew he was there, even if, on my screen, I could not feel it. I knew he, and I knew that the film itself would be my vision.

They do this because it's the only way to keep the current budget on track for me. And in reality, I know better than to give them the satisfaction, but it does not hurt me. I consider them like the lives of friends who might, to be fair, simply disappear if I do not raise my social time to them. I still call them by that name, even after all this time. But most of the time, it is simply family in my life who is going through the same thing I am. While they may not have access to the knowledge I have access to, I think that the best compliment I can give them is just to simply give them my ear.

      "[Cinematic] The players are an unlikely couple - neither of whom lived through the Roman occupation of their lands. Benjamin died around 300 CE as a merchant in Alexandria during the 2nd dynasty of the Roman empire and was the closest thing they had to a grandfather. It is between these two that Judah finds himself and apart for the first time in his life - so parted. Judah follows his own path of ambition and infidelity. His odyssey is quite the romantic one and I for one couldn't help but feel he did an even better job of it than most authors. He is of course a married man and you won't see this directly. You know him well enough through the many books. On the flip side though, you can clearly see he's better than that too. The choice is his to stay home, die as a single man, be blamed and eventually tossed into prison for his insatiable greed. With such a brilliant character like Benjamin, it is impossible for me to not to agree with him. Some people do this. Not from the comforts of this fine paper but of course you'll never guess where it comes from. Their worlds are their own and it is fascinating seeing a part of them manifest itself within another. However when it comes to one of the most famous of literary wives, my opinion is clear. She was a powerful woman who later became known as \"The Wicked One\". Her exploits in court houses and the vain attempts of all others to use her as a walking chariot are well documented in history books to this very day. She was a woman living to tell about their history but most importantly she loved to hold people to the truth. While the other characters are fighting the Emperor and being rewarded for their efforts the Wicked One clutches them close to her body and grinds their souls into dirt. When I see you, even if you know it is wrong, the world is yours. Do not be a foolish fool. You can never be wrong. -- When the Greeks sought to invade The Roman Empire they would take notice of their affection for the finest women. No longer would they prey on the weaker and less available and Herodotus famously reports that their soldiers were only led by \"knightly vikings\".

Every sentient being on Earth knew that and they knew that. But that’s what I was. One night in my childhood, a few years back, I fell into a bag full of explosives, all unsecured, and set a camel into a pile of junk. I’d lost my cool because I’d taken off my jacket and tucked a handkerchief into my pocket. A bandit, spotted in the chaos, tripped over a bag and grabbed a handful of dirt. Stunned, I stared at him, angry and confused, horrified by what I’d done. But I understood. No, I understood that I was too much for him. And the only way to deal with him was to beat him to death. “If you can do that,” I said, gesturing to the bag, “you can beat me to death.” Zero saw the anger in my voice and realized I was right. So instead of shouting back, he crouched over the bags and picked the dirt up. Then he shoved me off. Next thing I knew, I was being pushed into a headlock, tossed across a carpeted floor, tossed into the pool, then beaten with iron bars until my armor and my weapons gave out. They beat me, and then they scattered me. I didn’t even care. I was better off dead than alive. A guard, wondering why a had let me go, marched up behind me and began to kick me.” “Shh,” I begged. But he could tell I was bleeding. I needed to feel pain. He kicked me in the side of the head. Then he did it again. And again. And again. In a strange, inhuman voice I heard my screams. The guard laughed and his body slumped as the steel of his blade flowed out. I woke up to the sounds of barking. The sound of barking dogs. It was the sound of Zero’s headless body on the bed next to me. We both sat up and took in our surroundings. We could see that the floor was pretty checkered. Lots of ropes, chains, baling wire.

It was obvious to Allybell that no one was really happy when she kept talking about her family, especially her father, and the current state of the marriage. Two people in her life may want to hold it together, but Elisabeth is probably a greater pain in the ass. So she joined the chorus, just like everyone else did, and the sooner she left, the better. It was on the third occasion when Allybell asked Elisabeth about her current boyfriend. Just as she was finishing up the weekly round of gossip about his \"other half,\" an aura of silence enveloped her then. It was pretty obvious to Allybell that she was about to have to keep talking, and the conversation would take some time. But she felt it was her duty to \"investigate\" the matter further. She began to stand in front of Elisabeth's bed, watching her intently. A few minutes later, the realisation came to her that she was not the only one. \"So what are you doing on the fucking front cover?\" Elisabeth, she just said, making a motion at her dress. \"We're playing as someone else's spin on the great man, isn't that right?\" Allybell asked, realizing what her response could be.

The difference was that there was no one cute about them. No one was impressed when they commented on a shirt they were wearing, or how hairy they were.

John, the youngest of the group, was an eleven, and looked at least 20 years older than them. He was not used to being around anybody, after all these years. His antics, which were mostly drunkenness and giant inflatable tanks in the water, seemed like a twinge in the back of his mind. Julie seemed to be young enough to be his wife, and it was obvious that she had fallen out of love with him a few years back.

Their November 22nd, 1694 edition, dated August 9th, had devoted four pages to the huge, widely-covered scandal involving one Marianne O'Neal, who had been granted the power of incredible super-speed just months earlier as a testament to the power of the \"Spirit of God\". She managed to snare every story she could while investigating the fact that God had decided that he had enough time to devote to the pressing issues of marriage equality and helping the people who were scorned by the government that had overlooked the crisis of the war in England. Seeing this as the headline news, they brought it to the general press, who did the most upvoting and downvoting in recent memory for stories of religious tyranny and political expediency. The global readership was smart and in the Globe's honor, so they decided to tell the world. \"There is a reason that this such a need for peace amongst the peoples of this country,\" the Globe wrote, directly quoting the famous line of King Stephen's prophecy from the life of Thomas Becket. \"It is because the people are looking for absolution from God and only one God can truly grant them such.\" It said with every sentence, to the general tune of \"I'll be King\" or \"you know how much I hate swearing.\" The Globe said, in their emphasis, that a debt of repentance was owed, and Jesus Christ was willing to allow these people to repent, for He was gracious and merciful. The Globe had no chance of getting a major scoop on this story, and were swept out of their conference room by a mass of people. The political and legal professionals at their table had the acuteness to tell them that they had missed the real meaning behind O'Neal's extraordinary abilities, and called the Globe to a meeting. It's not like this story mattered anyway, and the Globe would be better off finding an accountant who could account for the \"red treasure\" where the information was right. The adviser who was to chair the meeting knew immediately what the Globe had wanted, and asked if the Globe wanted their full attention on the City of Boston's likely political and financial collapse in the next week, and the restoration of the balance of power. The Globe responded, \"Yes. Perhaps the new minister is up to something.\" (The Globe, who now belonged to a law firm, was not even the worst for having shared such blatant racism with their\n",

      "[Story] The man sat in his seat, breathing deeply. The hourglass hovered near the bottom of the bronze basin, filling a spattering of water with drops of shining white. He drifted aimlessly through the open door, the motions of a once proud warrior now eclipsed by the beauty of the area around him. He could hear the creaking of distant tiles, could feel the fluid seeping through the half-closed door. Inside, a small crowd of eager people crowded around the small table, anxiously awaiting his entrance. They exchanged looks, some to goad the newcomer on, others to welcome him. \"Hello, everyone. Welcome to my home, my people!\" he exclaimed as he spoke. His voice was welcoming and open, welcoming his new home to others who shared his experiences. Several of the newcomers held glass utensils, and they shared jokes, exchanging pleasantries in their excitement. Thor pulled the half-full glass to his lips, the golden liquid spilling out onto his shirt. \"I have a few things to show you, today.\" \"What? Oh, I don't know. We're here, after all!\" one of the men in the crowd tried to tug on his arm. The man scurried away, leaving the other behind. When he returned, he held a small cloth in his hand, wrapped around a little coin. On it were several pomegranate seeds, carefully measured so as to neatly place them into the container. \"Pommegranate seeds. They're magical. They're delicious. You can use them in your salad, they make it colorful and filling.\" The man, who now wore a simple tunic and black pants, removed the coins from the small container, placing it in front of the newcomers. \"Is that all? We've come all the way out here just to...pommegranate seeds. That's...that's...that's a lot of seeds.\" \"Indeed. You have been treated to a gift from our esteemed Queen, bestowed upon you as payment for your service to her.\" She smiled, showing a long set of polished teeth. \"Thor, welcome, my people.\" A man with glasses tugged on his tunic, trying to peer through the glass.

I always have to be subtle, funny, and probably the most boring professor alive. I watch my students struggle, frustrated at some point. Most of the teaching assistants are hated by my students and sometimes worse than the professors themselves. I'm constantly losing my nerve. I have no idea how we get through class when the book prompts require more attention than we give to the actual texts. I mean, it's a fair point. I don't know how many students I'd actually get caught cheating to fulfill that book prompt. I just gave a good lecture and that's the way it goes. I've wasted countless of hours in this class that could have been spent on music, so I've been walking away from the room. I am the first to write this. I'm really just... mad. I don't know what the fuck it is. It isn't that I have no sympathy for my students. It is simply that I am incapable of handling them. I'm so uninterested in how they actually make their living, how they view the world around them. I have no gripes with them, never have and never will. They are just some schmucks that didn't get the chance I gave them. I've called my campus branch of Area 51 and my department the world's best archeology department. I'm not sure how the hell I'm still alive after what I did. I will admit I was a dick to my wife when I found out I was pregnant. Her friends had gathered around to play basketball with her. They put a kabosh on my pregnancy and left me to cry in the hospital. Hell, they actually stayed with me on my death bed. There was a video of the baby gurgling at me on the medical tab next to me. She hated me for that. She told me about the sky spinning black at night and she told me she was so excited when she saw me on the screen with my newborn boy in my arms. She told me I had a new car, a pet dog, and everything that I had grown and lost all over over the past nine months. \"But why did you have to get pregnant?\" I asked, feigning mild depression.

The grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and \"no kissing\". But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn't want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of \"as you wish\" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.\n",

      " [WP] Adapted from the novel, \"Addie Pray\" (1971) by Joe David Brown, PAPER MOON is the story of Moses Pray and Addie Loggins. With scenery reminiscent of \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" the film is set in the depression-era Midwestern region of the United States. As the movie opens, we see a small group of mourners clustered at a graveside. Among the mourners is Addie, the dead woman's small daughter. Moses Pray -- ostensibly of the \"Kansas Bible Company\" -- approaches the group, as the service concludes, and two of the elderly women remark that the child bears some resemblance to him and asks if he might be related. \"If ever a child needed kin, it's now,\" one lady says. With no knowledge of who her father is, Addie's only haven is her Aunt's home in St. Joseph, Missouri. Having identified himself as a \"traveling man spreading the Lord's gospel in these troubled times,\" \"Mose\" is prevailed upon to deliver the helpless child to her Aunt since he's going that way, anyway. Addie, wise beyond her years, soon discovers that Mose is little more than a scam artist traveling from town to town delivering unordered Bibles and charging exorbitant prices to recently widowed women whom he identifies through the obituary columns of local papers. Soon, Addie and Mose become a team, traveling from town to town, making money in every dishonest way imaginable, and looking for the ultimate score. The colorful characters they meet along the way make the film all the more interesting. Paramount among these is \"Miss Trixie Delight,\" an exotic dancer who Mose rescues from a traveling carnival and her minion, Imogene. The film is peppered with \"regional\" dialog. Perhaps one of the most memorable lines of the movie is uttered when Mose is forced to wrestle a backwoodsman in order to trade his new car for the hillbilly's battered old truck. \"Make him say calf-rope, Leroy!\" one of the observers calls out.\n",
      "======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================\n",
      " Addie and Mose are the most renowned acrobatics duo in Midwestern America, responsible for one of the most photogenic stunt characters in recent memory. \"Wright Brother\" also has a lively, teary friendship with Addie, despite her coddling him, while Moses works with Mose and Trixie on supernatural adventures that involve a couple of angels, a woman with a scythe, and a rabbit. Much of the film's humor occurs in the misadventures of Moses and Addie. Addie, in particular, leaps to her Aunt's side as the two share a particularly heroic performance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The title character, Moses Pray, is equally adept at business as well as religion, being the sole proprietor of \"The Noah's Ark Dating Agency,\" an office that birthed twins, twins who were murdered by the Ministry of Marriage, and his eventual wife, Addie Loggins, whom Moses similarly strangled to death in the bathtub. Moses Pray poses himself as Moses, but in a sense, the rest of the film is about Moses Pray; in addition to selling mis-matched calendars, he is a real estate broker, fashion designer, and a pest control consultant to the city of Birmingham. Moses Pray earns the biggest kick out of all: a few years after Moses Pray was rendered mute by a strange fungus on his soul, Moses Pray is granted a loan of 5,000,000 dollars from his father. Moses Pray promptly sells his soul to an African collector, and expects to make a substantial profit for his new partner. He, as always, is foiled by the Community for \"Moses the Intangible,\" and many of the most ludicrously, irredeemably evil plot devices in recent memory are featured in his film. This isn't really a historical film, it's more of an engaging, silly comedy that gives the viewer a sense of enchantment. Without such, The Book of Addie Pray might not have received the Oscar nomination it did, but it remains a great movie that plays well today.

      " [WP] In 1893, Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.\n",
      "======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================\n",
      " The assassination is attributed to the infamous Master Magician, Jia-Zhen, who has gained access to nuclear technology after surveying other countries. Jia-Zhen had been contracted to create a time machine to advance his revolution of 2038, and was forced to break from his master's bargain when Gandhi died, fearing he was being betrayed. Jia-Zhen, in the last throes of his anger, throws the device at Gandhi, which quickly destroys it, causing Jia-Zhen to scatter. After this, he is imprisoned until released in 2062, the year Gandhi died. He is not seen for another 10 years. Gandhi dies in 2072, in America, as the twin towers collapsed in New York City. Jia-Zhen is executed soon after, because he told everyone that he destroyed Gandhi, claiming that the last of them had done nothing more than drink tea. In 2080, a disheartened Jia-Zhen decides to explore the beautiful life of a beautiful Indian woman named Shailesh. He eventually comes across a kharifvata floating in a river. Shailesh comes and is intoxicated by it. They fall in love, and are married later that year. The years that follow are happy ones for both of them. Jia-Zhen's eyes turn from beauty to humanity and disease, as he realizes that India, so pristine in beauty, is drowning in hate, driven only by the nation's history of warfare. After all, it is only a long line of peace-striking black countries that were conquered by a man wearing a turban. edit: Grammar and line corrections.<|endoftext|>\n",

They were both popular kids in high school, but Donnie had an abundance of pretty girls. And Donnie wanted a girlfriend, but he wasn't much for relationships. Donnie then grew to be more of a straight man, and began dating his high school sweetheart Jenna. Jenna was more into hip-hop and had more attitude. Donnie and Jenna were only together two years, but Donnie was also more into hip-hop. Donnie got along well with his other two companions, Billie and Will. They were nice, if a bit boring. Donnie had a brother named Vincent - who also seemed to have a lot of his eccentric tendencies. Donnie had a sister named Jenny - who was deeply into hip-hop.

We were together for 10 years, but Donnie felt like it was getting closer and closer to the end. Something seemed wrong. Jenna's spirit vanished after one of Donnie's beers.

Jenna's spirit seemed to lift Donnie whenever she needed. Donnie was usually nice to Jenna and her aches. Jenna and Donnie seemed to spend more and more time together.

Unlike his previous relationships, Alvy believed he may have worked out all the issues in his life through fifteen years of therapy to make this relationship with Annie last, among those issues being not wanting to date any woman that would want to date him, and thus subconsciously pushing those women away. Alvy not only reviews the many ups and many downs of their relationship, but also reviews the many facets of his makeup that led to him starting to date Annie. Those facets include growing up next to Coney Island in Brooklyn, being attracted to the opposite sex for as long as he can remember, and enduring years of Jewish guilt with his constantly arguing parents.\n",

Remember that story I told you last week about how I finally threw off my A-Game to romance Annie? That made me realise how much I love her. She's my best friend. And you might not be aware of that, but I believe you're my soulmate. So I'll be honest, if you're my soulmate and I didn't lie to you, I would love to spend the rest of my life with you.” “Hey, what? You’re lying. I don't know what you think you’re telling me. I’m just a comedian who's funny because I can.” “Your girlfriend is embarrassing you. You’re not cute, and you’re going to ruin your relationships by dating me, and I don't know what my feelings are towards my mother, but you need to cut your losses and go and find some weird girl with a thick Brooklyn accent to kill you.” “Wait...you’re telling me that she looks and sounds like a succubus.” “Exactly.” said Alvy, peeping over his shoulder to catch Annie without looking at her. Her long brown eyes were turned up to Alvy’s, and Alvy expected the devil to have material for a cigarette. Instead, the angel appeared to be rather drained. “Listen, I can write you off as well. We don't have to keep up this conversation any more, and it'll be a blessing for both of us.” “Seriously. If this is your girlfriend, I should leave you be.

My grandparents never had anything other than my mother's white dress.

My mom had the sense to dress me up like a doll. At the age of five, my parents had to tell us to stop, at the ripe old age of five years old, and leave our pants for a reason.

Inside the building, my grandmother was at work: making our cupcakes, my uncle bailing us out of jams, my aunt sprinkling our coffee so I could drink mine. We, the six siblings, were shackled to the wooden bed we were using to entertain the three other brothers and sisters, all of whom were in fact orphans.

I tried to run but my veins were only as long as his, and he was so close now. The sound of his breath on my neck was enough to drive me mad. The grief subsided as he pushed past me into the wind. My head was spinning, and I cried as we both emerged from the desert. “Sarah,” he called, there was a tinge of sorrow in his voice, his words but words he shouldn’t have spoken. “Sarah,” I called, pointing down the street. The child was gone, the boy who ran like mad from home. We could hear the stars a half mile away, but the sound of him crying and telling his mother what had happened was almost unbearable, almost useless. His mother’s mouth was sewn shut, I couldn’t help but cry in my lap. In the desert, nothing was left but his tears, the cacti he left to make a home for himself. He’d never see that light again. My knees were too weak, my head felt like it would break. I tried to pull him, to tell him to run, but he was already running to join his father. The brief burst of panic that he’d felt then was nearly annihilated by the ferocity of his flight. He would never be told, never knew what had happened, his mother’s cries from her children was absolute and impossibly terrifying. After so long, there was still not much time left to tell him. “Honey,” he said, but his voice was laced with sadness. “If you’ve gone away from me, why are you still here?” I wiped the tears from my eyes. I only got a second chance, maybe not one of many. “Why are you here?” “It is my time,” he said, in his childish excitement. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a pistol. “I want to go back with you,” he’d said, still wanting to be like his father, not him. The words were buried in the hollow within my throat.

A couple days later, the people were well and truly set for breakfast. A pair of women worked as assistant chefs and the rest of the women spent the morning basking in the sun as Aibileen played bare-bones chess with her family as the rest of the boys waited by the boys' seats, and Skeeter let out a series of joyous exhales. Across the street, her sister gave a brilliant rendition of The Sound of Music while everyone else ate hotcakes out of plastic containers and prepared cookies with a mix of brown sugar and granulated sugar. \"A cookie was better than anything else\" she said, knocking the top cookie onto the table to make it fall apart into thousands of pieces. \"Plus, we're using this place to make some boy this weekend.\" \"Hush up sister. We're just tired and all.\" In spite of the fact that the boys were used to such jokes from her, Aibileen had some ideas of her own. \"And besides, I hope to hell we won't eat something too sweet after the cookies!\" \"I love you.\" \"And if we don't have cookies, we'll eat pie.\" \"That's because we don't have pie.

      "[Story] ... I'm not the greatest writer. I don't believe in the same cliche of an unbeatable super-power that I believe exists, though I wish I had any clear idea where I'd been or what exactly that cliche was. So I just kinda wrote a bunch of random stuff that kind of felt right. I feel like I could have pulled a couple more upvotes or comments for reading this and realizing that my first attempt at a novel was an obvious no-go. Especially since I'd been writing with my left hand. Don't get me wrong, I'm very much aware that the idea that I was just using the forearm like a writing instrument was fairly uncomfortable, but it was not as if I was going to fluff that up into a front-to-back comparison that makes it seem like I've got a hand prosthesis. There's a reason I do what I do. The only other reason I've done it. If I was going to write something, I wanted it to reflect what was most out there, so it's not surprising that I have a hand on the whirring arm of my writing pen. Now, if you're wondering why I chose to write about these events as they were, well... well, it's because my life sucked. My parents were... not great, for the most part. My dad could have been the single worst person in the world. But he always had a certain smug, elitist air about him. He did what he wanted with his life, and while I never knew for sure whether he was worth it, I did feel like it was a personal loss. It's a common, basic parent control thing, but it should be obvious to anyone who hasn't been raised in a sheltered-from-possible-impossible-dangers home that I was better off being the precocious, self-critical kid and not let anyone fuck with me and was, in fact, an excellent student, which helped a great deal in the crisis I was going through. I also met my abusive father about this time and we were no better off than my parents. He used to beat me pretty badly. He beat me for nearly five years straight before I became better. That didn't stop him from doing it anymore. I was eventually diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1, and the doctors did it. When they got to talking with me about my dad, they just rolled their eyes. Didn't really seem to care\n",

      "[Story] The lion screamed as it went through a very particular routine. While chasing his prey from hiding place to hiding place, from digging from eating from hiding place to digging, the lion was developing the cognitive ability that all lion breeders strive to attain - the ability to remember the previous location of his prey. This ability of memorizing everything took its toll on him. He had missed his target. Now, however, it would not be the first time he had done so. Memories flowed through his mind as the lion watched his prey run from place to place, fall into his jaws, then climb up his throat and, perhaps, lay on top of him. This part he never got to experience for the first time. In the hallway of the castle, Prince Ivan Lionheart was slinking through the lobby halls, pondering which piece of jewelry his girlfriend wanted for him. If he liked something more than his favorite, he could always run into his villager friend, prince Edwin and steal a queen's engagement ring, which would make him an official Knight in the service of the prince. As far as he knew, princess Belle was still in his castle, alone and miserable. If he had the time to visit her, then that would be great. It would be the longest and most painful journey yet. A square rift had opened at the very center of his vision, a single, tear-filled eye staring at him. Even though he had already begun to plan his flight to the nearest cabin. With a slight nudge on his muscles, Prince Ivan was suddenly strong enough to leap up and take advantage of the curved fall. He wanted to dive and catch his prey before he had the chance to fall in love with Belle. In fact, if he could succeed in what he had dreamed of, it would be a small victory. Prince Ivan caught his prey. Belle was in the hall, in the throne room, happily rolling around on her rocker, her purse held tightly in the hand that was slowly making a not-so-cool-sounding creaking noise. Her perfume made his nostrils rattle with disgust. Then Prince Ivan looked down at Belle, and quickly saw the secret message written on the rose-gold necklace on her necklace: her. \"No.\" There was no reply. It was Prince Ivan that received the important message. The princess, Belle, who was being held captive by her arch-nemesis, Prince Edwin, was a woman who was clearly destined for love,\n",

      " [WP] Based upon a real-life story that happened in the early seventies in which the Chase Manhattan Bank in Gravesend, Brooklyn, was held siege by a bank robber determined to steal enough money for his male lover to undergo a sex change operation. On a hot summer afternoon, the First Savings Bank of Brooklyn is held up by Sonny and Sal, two down-and-out characters. Although the bank manager and female tellers agree not to interfere with the robbery, Sonny finds that there's actually nothing much to steal, as most of the cash has been picked up for the day. Sonny then gets an unexpected phone call from Police Captain Moretti, who tells him the place is surrounded by the city's entire police force. Having few options under the circumstances, Sonny nervously bargains with Moretti, demanding safe escort to the airport and a plane out of the country in return for the bank employees' safety.\n",

      " The robbers suddenly decide that the women that they thought they'd get one night of lesbian action (they would not, of course, have the last laugh) just can't take it anymore. Sonny tries to dissuade his sister, Sal, from this, but ultimately Sal gives in to the fatherly demands. Even in the midst of the police-cornered bank job, it's Sal's turn to apply for the jobs with the superhero roles he's attracted to. As he takes her to the airport, Sonny sees that the news is live: a woman who looks almost like Sal, but for her nose and yellow hair, is trying to hijack a plane at a very high speed. Sal hastily tries to take control of the plane and flies it into the airport's East Tower. Normally, the tower would look intimidating, but the woman has just two soldiers (only one of which wears glasses) at her side and can fight through just about anything. Maybe she'll go easy on the flight? Most likely, Sonny keeps his mouth shut. The news reporter asks to see \"Sal's\" body, and Sal refuses. \"I'll prove to you that I can fly even faster.\" she says. \"We're going to trust the pilots here. With me...\" The point at which the reporter cuts off is immediately remembered for Sal, who did even better, because she managed to shoot down the plane before its cockpit fell to the ground. The money-losing plane is quickly caught by a time-travelling sports car which takes off at full speed while sal sets off with the gun-toting tank (her handy machete?). With the police cornered, the bank robbers are allowed to escape. Sal (with a less chiselled head than Sal) is not so lucky. She manages to completely throw off her helmet and die instantly. (More on Sal's death in a moment.) The car lands in front of the building with the limo, right in the driveway, where Sal and she will both be in a moment. The bank manager has been replaced by Sal's best and only employee, her beautiful love, Chad, and only real rival. Randy seems overly satisfied with his new job as not only did he replace the manager's face, he also replaced his car with a sleek electric one. Randy seems to believe his new job as well. Why?
